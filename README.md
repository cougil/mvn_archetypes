Maven Archetypes
==============

Different types of [maven archetypes](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html) for quickly starting Java projects.

Navigate into each archetype folder and type

    mvn install

This will install the archetype into your maven repository. Then, inside your IDE, when creating a new project, install and select the archetype you need.
